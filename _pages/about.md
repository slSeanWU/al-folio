Hello! I'm Shih-Lun. I'm studying towards [Master of Language Technologies](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/mlt/) at CMU's [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/), [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/).

My research has focused on <b>Language Model-based Music Generation</b>, where I was supervised by the wonderful Dr. [Yi-Hsuan Yang](https://citi.sinica.edu.tw/pages/yang/invited_talk_zh.html). Feel free to listen to our model's creative works [here](https://slseanwu.github.io/site-musemorphose/), or even [compose](https://github.com/slSeanWU/jazz_transformer) with it! I've also worked with Dr. [Chung-Wei Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cwlin/) and Dr. [Eunsuk Kang](https://eskang.github.io/) on <b>Formal Verification under Weakly-hard Constraints</b>.

Prior to joining CMU, I received my B.Sc. degree (in Computer Science) at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english). Also, I've been with two vibrant Taiwanese AI R&D teams: [Asus AICS Center](https://aics.asus.com/home/), and [Taiwan AI Labs](https://ailabs.tw/), working first as a software dev intern, and later as a research engineer.
