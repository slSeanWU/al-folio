<b>
NEWS (May '24): I will join MIT EECS as a PhD student in Fall 2024, where I will be advised by Prof. [Anna Huang](https://czhuang.github.io).
</b>

Hello! I'm Shih-Lun. I recently graduated with a [M.Sc. in Language Technologies](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/mlt/) from CMU's [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/), [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/), where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Shinji Watanabe](https://sites.google.com/view/shinjiwatanabe) and Prof. [Chris Donahue](https://chrisdonahue.com/). I'm worked on <b>Controllable Music Generation</b>, <b>Audio Captioning</b>, and <b>Spoken Language Understanding</b>. I was a research scientist intern at the Audio AI Lab of [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/) for Summer 2023 (mentor: Dr. [Nick Bryan](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~njb/)), where we built the [Music ControlNet](https://musiccontrolnet.github.io/web/).

Prior to joining CMU, I received my B.Sc. degree (in Computer Science) from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english). Also, I've been with two vibrant Taiwanese AI R&D teams: [Asus AICS Center](https://aics.asus.com/home/), and [Taiwan AI Labs](https://ailabs.tw/), working as a software dev intern at first, and later as a research engineer.

My undergraduate research focused on <b>Language Model-based Music Generation</b>, where I was advised by the wonderful Dr. [Yi-Hsuan Yang](https://affige.github.io/). Feel free to listen to our model's creative works [here](https://slseanwu.github.io/site-musemorphose/), or even [compose](https://github.com/slSeanWU/jazz_transformer) with it! I've also worked with Prof. [Chung-Wei Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cwlin/) and Prof. [Eunsuk Kang](https://eskang.github.io/) on <b>Formal Verification under Weakly-hard Constraints</b>.
